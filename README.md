# Tax Calculator

Welcome to the Tax Calculator website! This web application allows users to calculate their tax based on their gross annual income, extra income, applicable deductions, and age group. The tax calculation follows specific rules based on the user's inputs.

## Website Link

You can access the Tax Calculator website using the following link: [Tax Calculator Website](https://bittukr7479.github.io/TaxCalculator/#overallIncome)

## How to Use

1. **Input Fields**
   - Enter your gross annual income in the "Enter gross annual income" field.
   - Enter any extra income from other sources in the "Enter extra income" field.
   - Select your age group from the dropdown menu.
   - If applicable, enter any deductions in the "Enter total applicable deductions" field.

2. **Submit Button**
   - Click the "Submit" button to calculate your tax based on the provided inputs.
   - The website will display the final income after tax in the result section.

3. **Error Handling**
   - If you enter invalid or empty values in the input fields, an error message will be displayed prompting you to enter valid information.
   - Ensure that all required fields are filled and contain valid numeric values before clicking "Submit."

## Tax Calculation Logic

- If your net income (after deductions) is below 8 Lakhs, no tax is applicable.
- For net income exceeding 8 Lakhs:
  - The tax rate varies based on your age group:
    - 30% for age < 40
    - 40% for age ≥ 40 but < 60
    - 10% for age ≥ 60
  - The tax is calculated based on the amount exceeding 8 Lakhs and subtracted from your net income to determine the final income after tax.
